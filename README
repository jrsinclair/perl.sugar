ABOUT
=====
This is planned to make Espresso understand perl.
At least the syntax highlighting should be supported.
So I decided to take some time to help all perl lovers like me.

Installation
============
Download the perl.sugar and copy to ~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/
Restart Espresso

Of course you can install manually with git.
git clone git://github.com/markuszeller/perl.sugar.git
copy that file to ~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/

HISTORY
=======
Version 0.10
Syntax highlighting is possible.
Not everything is completed, but works fine for the first use.
Current filetypes: .pl, .pm, .cgi
