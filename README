This is planned to make Espresso understand perl.
At least the syntax highlighting should be supported.
So I decided to take some time to help all perl lovers like me.

Version 0.10
Syntax highlighting is possible.
Not everything is completed, but works fine for the first use.
Current filetypes: .pl, .pm, .cgi
